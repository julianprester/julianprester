**Hi, I'm Julian.** I'm a Lecturer of Business Information Systems at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au). I like to tinker with [Python](https://github.com/julianprester/deep-cenic). I've also done web dev and [Android](https://github.com/julianprester/RemindMail) stuff. You can see some of my academic work on my [website](https://julianprester.com).
