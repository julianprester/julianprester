**Hi, I'm Julian.** I'm a PhD candidate in Information Systems at [UNSW](https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/) in Sydney. I like to tinker with [Python](https://github.com/julianprester/deep-cenic). I've also done web dev and [Android](https://github.com/julianprester/RemindMail) stuff. You can see some of my academic work on my [website](https://julianprester.com).
